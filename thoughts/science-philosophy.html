            <p>In <em>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</em>, Robert Pirsig wrote, “For every fact there is an infinity of hypotheses.” This statement captures a fundamental principle of scientific exploration: every “fact” is a provisional truth resting on numerous “self-evident” assumptions. Science is not a collection of absolute truths but a dynamic process that refines our understanding through evidence, logic, and skepticism.</p>
            <p>The transition from the geocentric to the heliocentric model illustrates how scientific “truths” evolve. Initially dismissed as heresy, Copernicus’s heliocentric model gained acceptance through Kepler’s laws and Galileo’s telescopic observations. Today, even a four-year-old can take the heliocentric model as “common sense” and scoff at the geocentric view as ignorance. Yet, this “common sense” was hard-won. Technological advancements have since revealed a far larger cosmos where neither Earth nor the Sun occupies a central position. Similarly, paradigms in modern science continue to shift. For example, the amyloid hypothesis, long dominant in Alzheimer’s disease research, is now under scrutiny following repeated clinical trial failures. Alternative theories, such as neuroinflammation and metabolic dysfunction, are emerging, underscoring how scientific facts are shaped by available evidence and theoretical frameworks.</p>
