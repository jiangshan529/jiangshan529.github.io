            <p>In <em>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</em>, Robert Pirsig wrote, “For every fact there is an infinity of hypotheses.” This statement captures a fundamental principle of scientific exploration: every “fact” is a provisional truth resting on numerous “self-evident” assumptions. Science is not a collection of absolute truths but a dynamic process that refines our understanding through evidence, logic, and skepticism.</p>
            <p>The transition from the geocentric to the heliocentric model illustrates how scientific “truths” evolve. Initially dismissed as heresy, Copernicus’s heliocentric model gained acceptance through Kepler’s laws and Galileo’s telescopic observations. Today, even a four-year-old can take the heliocentric model as “common sense” and scoff at the geocentric view as ignorance. Yet, this “common sense” was hard-won. Technological advancements have since revealed a far larger cosmos where neither Earth nor the Sun occupies a central position. Similarly, paradigms in modern science continue to shift. For example, the amyloid hypothesis, long dominant in Alzheimer’s disease research, is now under scrutiny following repeated clinical trial failures. Alternative theories, such as neuroinflammation and metabolic dysfunction, are emerging, underscoring how scientific facts are shaped by available evidence and theoretical frameworks.</p>
            <p>This perspective resonates with my own research experiences. In our study of the genetic mechanisms underlying tail loss in humans and apes, we identified TBXT as a key factor, providing evidence that garnered praise from the broader scientific community. However, critical questions remain: Is TBXT truly the central driver of this evolutionary event? Such skepticism reflects the iterative nature of scientific progress. As Karl Popper argued, a theory’s validity lies in its falsifiability. These critiques not only refine our research but also expose the limitations of our evidence and reasoning.</p>
            <>What defines robust evidence? In our study, we proposed an evolutionary model and identified TBXT as an upstream regulator using gene network analysis. We also suggested additional hypotheses requiring experimental validation. However, some questions—such as the precise molecular events underlying tail loss 25 million years ago—may never be fully resolved without technologies like a time machine. This highlights biology as a dynamic, evolving field. Traditional notions like “one gene, one phenotype” are increasingly giving way to an understanding of genes and proteins as interconnected components in a dynamic equilibrium. This perspective continues to drive my fascination with gene regulation.</p>
            <>Can we ever fully uncover the truth behind a fact? Modern philosophy often examines the limits of scientific knowledge. For instance, quantum mechanics’ uncertainty principle reveals inherent unpredictability in nature. What we observe is shaped by the limitations of our tools and cognitive frameworks, not necessarily by the phenomena themselves. This idea brings to mind the philosophical thought experiment of the "brain in a vat," where a brain, disconnected from reality, experiences a simulated world indistinguishable from the real one. While such philosophical questions transcend science, they emphasize the importance of constant testing and refinement.</p>
            <>Doubt does not simply imply rejection; rather, it fosters humility and openness. Science’s strength lies not in delivering final answers but in creating a system that promotes continuous questioning and improvement. In my own research, using CRISPR to delete genomic segments frequently yielded unexpected outcomes, with only a 20% success rate. These deviations exposed the imperfections of our techniques but also spurred improvements and innovations. Despite its limitations, CRISPR has enabled transformative applications, such as editing blood cells to treat anemia. Tangible successes like these affirm science’s truth.</p>
            <>Ultimately, science is a journey of questioning assumptions rather than reaching absolute truths. Today’s assumptions may become tomorrow’s facts, and this cycle of refinement propels science forward. I often imagine a future, 400 years from now, where the causes of Alzheimer’s disease seem as obvious as the heliocentric model is today. Yet, just as we now view past thinkers as naive, future generations may regard our current understanding with similar disdain. If I could, I would tell those future scientists how much effort went into solving these mysteries. While I may not directly contribute to breakthroughs in Alzheimer’s research, I aim to make meaningful contributions in my own field, paving the way for future generations to build on our work.</p>
