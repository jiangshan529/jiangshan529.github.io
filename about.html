            <h3>My Journey</h3>
            <p>I was born and raised in China, where I developed a deep curiosity about the natural world. My academic journey led me to explore biology, particularly gene regulation and functional genomics. Over time, I have blended experimental and computational approaches to investigate biological questions.</p>
